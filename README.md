# DraftKings-KNN-Python
This repository houses code and files used to project NFL points scored on the DraftKings platform using KNN regression and leave-one-out cross validation (due to the small amount of training data). This code is easily customizable if desired. For example, the weighting of the variables could be tweaked if someone would want "projection" to be more heavily weighted than "salary".
